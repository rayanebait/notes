D'après cucumber_642 sur le discord de maths, en réponse à : I saw a nice riddle that said that if f, g are univariate polynomials over Q with the same image, then f and g differ by a linear change in coordinates. A number theory proof of this is not too hard, but I’m wondering if there’s a “purely” algebraic geometry proof. Further, what conditions on a field k are sufficient to prove that if f, g are univariate with the same image they differ by a linear change of coordinates? I know almost nothing about the geometry of settings where my field isn’t algebraically closed so I don’t even know what techniques to try.

il dit : btw you can generalise this a lot, eg if f and g are rational functions st f(Q) is a subset of g(Q) then f(x) = g(h(x)) for some h (proof: apply hilbert’s irreducibility theorem to f(X)-g(Y): there is a root for every X so there is a rational root X = h(Y)). in terms of ag, the subvariety consisting V of (x,y) \in A^2 such that f(x) = g(y) is such that the second projection V(Q) -> A^1(Q) is surjective (dense is also enough) so there exists a (generic) section A^1 - - -> V (which is of the form x -> (x,h(x)) for some rational h) hilbert’s irreducibility theorem holds over all finitely generated infinite fields
